    "# Special Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we talk about the __init__() mehod in python. First we talk about the special method in python. The reason we want to have special methods in our classes is for use to design class that act like the native class that python provided, and that provide seamless interaction with Python. A good example is the for the class to act as a extensions of python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the Python language, there are large number of special mehods names, and they fall into the following categories:\n",
    "    1. Attribute Access: These special methods implement what we see as object.attribute in an expression, object.attribute on the left-hand side of an assignment, and object.attribute in a del statement\n",
    "    2. Callables: This special method implements what we see as a function that is applied to arguents, much like the built in len() function\n",
    "    3. Collections: These special methods implement the numerous features of collections. This involves methods like sequence[index], mapping[key], some_set|other_set\n",
    "    4. Numbers: These special methods provide arithmetic operators and comparison operators. We can use these methods to expand the domain of numbers that python works with\n",
    "    5. Context: There are two special mehods we'll use to implement a context manager that works with the with statement\n",
    "    6. Iterators: There are special methods that define an iterator. This isn't essential since generator functions handle this feature so elegantly. However, we will take a look at how we can design our own iterators\n",
    "   \n",
    "## Chapter 1 starts\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start talking about the most basic special methods == __init__(), this method permits a greate deal of latitude in providing the initial values for an object. In the case of an immutable object, this is the essential definition of the instance, and clarity becomes very important. In Chapter 1, we will review the numerous design alternatives for this method\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start talking about the __init__() mehod, we will first take a look the class hierarchy in Python, and start with the super class of all, the Object class\n",
    "\n",
    "## The implicit superclass - Object\n",
    "\n",
    "Object is a very simple class definition that does not include anything (almost). It is possible for us to create an Object, however, many of the special methods will not work on this class. In the meantime, all the class we make is a extend of the object class, for example:"
